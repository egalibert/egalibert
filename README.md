### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Elliot, I just finished my studies at @HiveHelsinki(2023). I started my developer career in 2020 and have never looked back since.
I enjoy solving problems and love learning something new everyday! A lot of my commits have gone into the schools Vogsphear but projects are here. I also recently passed and finished Helsinki Universitys Python programming basic (5/5) and advanced parts (4/5).

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development through Helsinki University Full Stack Open program.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finding myself an internship.
